# NeuroVision Explorer

## Overview
**NeuroVision Explorer** is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate brain analysis through transcriptome tomography. This project utilizes the dataset `Tomo-seq 23028969` to provide a detailed and web-accessible anatomical space for researchers and enthusiasts in the field of spatial omics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the `Tomo-seq 23028969` study. The data file `tomoseq_23028969.tar.gz` can be downloaded from [SpatialDB](http://www.spatialomics.org/SpatialDB/download.php).

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

 **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Usman678/NeuroVision-Explorer.git
   cd NeuroVision-Explorer
## Usage
To use the NeuroVision Explorer, follow these steps:

**Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
First, you need to open the Jupyter Notebook. Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook NeuroVision\ Explorer.ipynb
This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser and allow you to interact with the NeuroVision Explorer.ipynb notebook.

**Analyze the Data:**
Next, open the NeuroVision Explorer.ipynb notebook in Jupyter. Follow the instructions within the notebook and execute the cells to process and analyze the dataset. The notebook is designed to guide you through the analysis steps, providing visualizations and insights into the spatial transcriptomics data.
