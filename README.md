## Overview

**NeuroVision Explorer** is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate brain analysis through transcriptome tomography. This project utilizes the dataset `Tomo-seq 23028969` to provide a detailed and web-accessible anatomical space for researchers and enthusiasts in the field of spatial omics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the `Tomo-seq 23028969` study. The data file `tomoseq_23028969.tar.gz` can be downloaded from [SpatialDB](http://www.spatialomics.org/SpatialDB/download.php).

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    \`\`\`sh
    git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Usman678/NeuroVision-Explorer.git
    cd NeuroVision-Explorer
    \`\`\`

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    \`\`\`sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use \`venv\Scripts\activate\`
    \`\`\`

3. **Download the dataset**:
   Download the `tomoseq_23028969.tar.gz` file from [SpatialDB](http://www.spatialomics.org/SpatialDB/download.php) and extract it into the project directory.

## Usage

To analyze the data, open the `NeuroVision Explorer.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter. Follow the instructions within the notebook and execute the cells to process and analyze the dataset. The notebook guides you through the analysis steps, providing visualizations and insights into the spatial transcriptomics data.
